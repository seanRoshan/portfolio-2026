# Conclusion

This is it: we’ve finished with all the advice I had to share on crafting a tech resume that represents you fairly. We went from looking “behind the scenes” at the hiring pipeline, then resume basics, structure, mistakes to avoid, and exercises to polish your resume. We analyzed characteristics of a good resume template and looked at “before” and “after” examples for resumes that did better after they were refactored.

The resume screen is the very first step in an otherwise long hiring process. I hope this book and its advice will serve you well in clearing this first step at more places than you did before.

If you have success stories to share after updating your resume, or have other feedback, I’d love to hear from you at [hello@thetechresume.com](mailto:hello@thetechresume.com).

All the best on your journey!
