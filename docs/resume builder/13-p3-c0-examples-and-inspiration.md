# PART 3: EXAMPLES AND INSPIRATION

We’ve covered everything there is to know about writing a good developer resume. In Part 1, we went through the context on why resumes are important and how the hiring process works at most companies. Part 2 gave actionable advice on how to write a good resume, with examples on how to improve parts of a developer resume.

What you have not seen is something to get started with: templates or example resumes. This section is where we cover these.

[**Chapter 10: Good Resume Templates**](./p3-c1-good-resume-template-principles.md) covers the principles on what makes for templates that are considered good and easy to read.

[**Chapter 11: Resume Templates**](./p3-c2-resume-templates.md) goes through the three resume templates that come with the book. We also analyze another eight resume templates that are popular with software developers, going through the good and bad characteristics of them.

[**Chapter 12: Resume Improvements and Examples**](./p3-c3-resume-improvement-examples.md) takes real resumes from developers who were looking for a job, analyzes them and shows improved versions people crafted after taking advice from this book. Personal details for all the resumes changed to anonymize the resume.

[**Chapter 13: Advice for Hiring Managers on Running a Good Screening Process**](./p3-c4-advice-for-hiring-managers-on-running-a-good-screening-process.md) is for any current or future hiring manager—even if you are not one today, one day this could be you! We’ll summarize ways to build a better resume screening process, to be inclusive of people whose resume would not represent them well.
