# Chapter 11: Resume Templates

A template is great help in getting started with a resume. It’s good practice to start with a tried and proven template, then customize it to your own style and preferences. In this section, we’ll review popular templates among developers—and analyze them with pros, cons and ways to improve the template, should you choose to use it.

There is no such thing as a perfect template. And a template is not worth much without great content—content that you will need to write.

## Resume Generators vs Resume Templates

There are several resume generator sites, like resume.io, EnhanCV, VisualCV, Resume Now, Europass and many more. Apart from Europass, all of these are paid solutions. In return for your money, they promise to generate resumes that are more professional and are proven to work. Their value proposition is that by using these services, you will increase your chances of getting your position.

**Unfortunately, almost all resume generator sites work poorly for software developer resumes: and this is because they are optimized for resumes for everyone**. Most sites try to cater from finance professionals to accounting, to teachers all the way to sales people. Take the example of resume.io and the range of professions they claim to cater for:

![Image represents a table displaying resume example categories and their respective counts.  The table is divided into three columns. The left column lists various job categories, such as 'Accounting & Finance,' 'Administrative,' 'Beauty & Wellness,' and others, each followed by a numerical value representing the number of resume examples available in that category.  The middle column contains additional categories like 'Hospitality & Catering,' 'Human Resource,' 'Information Technology (IT),' and so on, also followed by their corresponding numerical counts.  Similarly, the right column presents more categories, including 'Real Estate,' 'Retail,' 'Sales,' and others, each with an associated numerical count.  The top of the table includes the header 'Select resume example category,' and a highlighted link labeled 'All categories' with the total count (277) positioned to its right.  No explicit URLs or parameters are visible; the data presented is purely categorical and numerical, showing the distribution of resume examples across different professional fields.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c2-resume-templates%2F54-5MPPCO5W.png&w=3840&q=75)

Out of 277 resume templates, 10 are focused on tech, and 3 on software development. Still, as I reviewed all these templates, none were a choice I would strongly recommend as a technical hiring manager:

![Image represents a collage of eight different resumes, each showcasing a distinct professional profile.  The resumes are arranged in a grid of two rows and four columns. Each resume is clearly labeled at the top with the job title (e.g., 'Network Systems Analyst,' 'Programmer,' 'Web Developer,' 'Film and Video Editor,' 'Motion Graphics Artist,' 'Software Developer,' '3D Animator,' 'IT Manager') and is further identified by a candidate's name (e.g., Zach Cortez, Taylor Cook, Shane Gomez).  Each resume follows a consistent structure, including sections for 'Profile,' 'Employment History,' 'Education,' 'Skills,' 'Languages,' and 'References.'  Within each section, specific details are provided, such as job titles, company names, dates of employment, educational institutions attended, skills possessed, and contact information for references.  The information is presented in a clear and organized manner, with bullet points used to list key responsibilities and accomplishments.  There is no direct information flow between the resumes; they are presented independently as examples of effective resume formats.  Contact information, including email addresses and phone numbers, is visible for each candidate.  The resumes use a consistent visual style, with a clean and professional layout.  A star rating (ranging from one to five stars) is displayed above each resume, presumably indicating a level of quality or ranking.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c2-resume-templates%2F55-HA5J4OQI.png&w=3840&q=75)

Tech resume templates on resume.io. They look nice from afar, but aren’t great choices for developers. They almost all follow the hard to read two-column layouts and the template contents do not resemble anything in the real world.

**Almost all resume sites use content writers to craft software developer resumes** - and these resumes are not checked with engineering managers or recruiters in tech. This shows very clearly when you look at the specific examples. Take the Programmer resume example of resume.io:

![Image represents a tech resume for Taylor Cook, a programmer.  The resume is structured into sections:  'INFO' containing contact details (address: 1600 Amherst Way, Palo Alto, 94304, United States; phone: (315) 802-8179; email: taylor.cook@gmail.com; nationality: American); 'PROFILE' providing a brief summary ('Innovative Programmer and Internet Entrepreneur...'); 'SKILLS' listing key abilities (Performance Optimization, Troubleshooting and Solutions Deployment, Analytical Thinking Skills, Software Design and Development, Coding and Scripting); 'LANGUAGES' indicating proficiency in English and French; and 'EMPLOYMENT HISTORY' detailing two roles: Programmer at Johannes Initiative (Dec 2015 – Present, in Palo Alto) with bullet points describing responsibilities, and Programmer at Kindlinks, Inc. (Feb 2004 – Sep 2015, in Menlo Park, CA), also with bullet points outlining achievements. Finally, 'EDUCATION' shows a Master of Computer Science degree from Boston College (Aug 2001 – Jun 2004, in Boston).  The sections are clearly labeled and arranged vertically, with information flowing sequentially from personal details to professional experience and education.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c2-resume-templates%2F56-QN2P5ZCO.png&w=3840&q=75)

This resume template—supposedly created by professionals—has nothing to do with a software developer resume. It doesn’t have a single programming language listed. Yet it has spoken languages on the template. The skills section doesn’t even pass the buzzword bingo. And the template, with its two-column layout, is a poor choice for the resume.

**The criteria of a decent resume generator site** should be this:

1.  **Resume templates optimized for hiring managers**. Are the templates created with the actual audience and easy readability in mind?
2.  **Testimonials from real hiring managers**. While many resume generators and resume services claim that they’ll help you score more callbacks, I would expect any paid solution to back this up with real hiring managers or recruiters in their industry.
3.  **Real, successful resume examples**. Similar to testimonials from hiring managers, you should be vary of paying up, if a site doesn’t showcase real—even if anonymized—resume examples that got people hired.
4.  **For paid services: clear pricing and value proposition.** Several resume sites have “bait pricing” where they advertise as free, then follow dark patterns to charge. Some have unclear pricing tiers. If and when you pay, the value proposition should be clear. What do you get for your money, beyond a PDF resume?
5.  **Not quoting ATS myths and other false facts**. You can identify resume sites that try to sell resume templates and services without industry expertise. These sites typically quote things like "75% of resumes are never seen by humans" and other [ATS Myths](./p1-c2-the-hiring-pipeline.md#ats-myths-busted) in order to upsell their service.

I’ve searched extensively among resume generator sites, and most do not satisfy these requirements for software developer resumes. In my search, I’ve uncovered one that does so: [Standard Resume](http://pragmaticurl.com/standardresume-ttr). Not surprisingly, software engineers founded this site, built it for people in tech and in collaboration with technical hiring managers.

## Standard Resume: By Developers, for Developers

[Standard Resume](http://pragmaticurl.com/standardresume-ttr) is a resume generator site that lacks all the marketing promises that every other site does. However, they have what no other site has: real resume examples of software developers and engineering managers who used their service to craft resumes that got them jobs at the likes of Dropbox, Ebay, Facebook, Amazon and many others.

This resume site was founded by a group of techies working together at a SF startup. They used the MVP of the product to apply for jobs, and got offers from Dropbox and Metalab. In building the early version of Standard Resume, they wanted to solve for problems that no other resume generator on the market had an answer for:

-   **Generate both a web resume and a pdf one**. Sending over a PDF can be a hassle, especially when you are reaching out on LinkedIn. Standard Resume was built so you can send a link that renders your resume with the same layout as the PDF.
-   **Track views of your (web) resume**. How can you tell if someone has read your resume? By tracking if they visited the link you sent over.
-   **Import your details from LinkedIn** to your resume to make it quicker to build your CV.

I recommend using either [Standard Resume](http://pragmaticurl.com/standardresume-ttr), or one of the templates below to build your resume. While Standard Resume is a paid subscription, the biggest benefits of it are these:

1.  **The cleanest tech resume layouts I’ve seen**. You cannot “cram” the fonts, as UX professionals designed spacing for the resume templates. Almost everyone plays around with font sizes on templates, and the result is often a resume that feels crammed and unprofessional. I’ve had several people ask me if they can make the font size smaller on one of the other templates. With this solution, you need to worry about the content, not the design.
2.  **A web-only resume version** that you can send over even before formally applying for a job. If you DM people, reach out on LinkedIn, you often can’t send a PDF resume. But you can send a web link that has the same contents.
3.  **Web resume view tracking**, so you get a sense if someone has actually viewed the resume you shared over a link.
4.  **Real resume examples of real developers and engineering managers** who actually got jobs at tech companies with that resume. Almost all other resume sites fail to show real developer resume examples of people working at well-known tech companies. With Standard Resume, you can [browse real resumes](https://standardresume.co/examples) for software engineers, iOS, frontend developers, data scientists, engineering managers and other professions who have successfully used the service.

It should be of little surprise that almost all Standard Resume templates are single-column and all templates have a heavy focus on spacing and typography—another thing that sets it apart from other sites. As a hiring manager, all of these layouts are easy—even pleasant—to read.

![Image represents a portfolio of twelve different resume templates designed for a tech professional, specifically an Aerospace Engineer named Dana Andrews.  Each template is displayed as a separate card, showcasing variations in layout, style, and information presentation.  The cards are arranged in a grid, with six cards in the top row and six in the bottom. Each card features a resume for Dana Andrews, highlighting her experience at SpaceX, JPL/NASA, and Boeing.  The top row showcases styles labeled as 'Sidney' (Simple & Professional), 'Pender' (Minimal & Modern), 'Yow' (Traditional & Simple), 'Eton' (Minimal & Technical), 'Alexander' (Traditional & Condensed), and 'Cordova' (Bold & Elegant). The bottom row presents 'Arbutus' (Classic & Clean), 'Seymore' (Modern & Elegant), 'Keefer' (Technical & Modern), 'Georgia' (Bold & Eye-catching), 'Parker' (Simple & Modern), and 'Venables' (Traditional & Clean).  A checkmark next to the 'Parker' template indicates it's the selected option.  Each card's style is clearly labeled below the resume preview, providing a concise description of its visual characteristics.  The resumes themselves contain consistent information regarding Dana Andrews' experience, skills, and education, but the visual presentation differs significantly across the templates.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c2-resume-templates%2F57-GYLZGKE3.png&w=3840&q=75)

Resume templates from Standard Resume. Note that all but one follow the top-down template, with an easy-to-read structure and layout.

<table class="inside-out"><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>From the inside out: lessons learned from the founders of Standard Resume</strong></p><p>Riley Tomasek is a software engineer and a cofounder of Standard Resume. After users have created more than 100,000 resumes - much of this for software developers - he shares lessons he’s learned about what makes for a good resume in tech:</p><p><em><strong>“One of the most common mistakes is cramming a ton of content into a single page.</strong> This is the number one issue I see with software engineering resumes. Removing the whitespace between paragraphs and sections makes your resume harder to scan and read. So do tiny font sizes.</em></p><p><em><strong>The most important part of a resume is that it's easy to read.</strong> If the recruiter skips your resume because it's hard to read, nothing else—including the contents of your resume—matters. Either focus on the critical parts or make it two pages.</em></p><p><em><strong>Resume typography is particularly important</strong> when applying for jobs in tech, especially for design-heavy companies. Since resumes are mostly text, typography is responsible for a large part of your resume's first impression. Take the time to get the correct line length, font sizes, line heights, etc. — or let professionals handle it.”</em></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

I came across Standard Resume while researching resume generator sites. I was about to close with the recommendation of *not* recommending any resume generators for tech resumes. However, the clean approach Standard Resume takes, and the easy to read templates made me change my mind. I reached out to the team, offering feedback on the resume templates, and listed things I missed from the existing ones. We collaborated and helped them create the Parker and Venables themes based on my existing resume templates. These two themes are ones that I would recommend for software engineers - and we’ll review them in this chapter.

## Template Reviews

In the second half of the chapter, we’ll review both resume templates created for the book, as well as popular resume templates. The reviews all follow this format:

-   **Link** to the template or site that provides the template.
-   **Rating for software developers**: assessment on how well the template follows principles for good developer templates.
-   **The good**: positive highlights on the resume format. Even if you don’t use the template, you could take inspiration from the good parts.
-   **The bad**: characteristics that could be a disadvantage when working with the template.
-   **Ways to improve it:** ideas and suggestions on either improving or customizing the template.

Keep in mind that as most of these templates are popular, people likely had success with all of them, with the right content when applying for a position where they were a match for. The *content* of your resume is more important than the template itself.

## Recommended Resume Templates

The following resume templates are all solid—and proven—choices for software engineers and engineering managers:

-   The Pragmatic Engineer’s resume template
-   Standard Resume: Parker template
-   The Mono Engineers’ resume template
-   Markdown to PDF resume template
-   The Experienced Engineer’s resume template
-   Standard Resume: Venables template
-   CareerCup resume template

Let’s take a closer look at each of them.

**The Pragmatic Engineer’s Resume Template**

[The Pragmatic Engineer's Resume Template](http://pragmaticurl.com/resume-template-ttr-pragmatic-engineers) is a clean template that is a good choice to use for developers.

**Standard Resume Parker Template (Paid)**

[The Parker resume template](http://pragmaticurl.com/resume-template-ttr-standardresume-parker) from [Standard Resume](https://standardresume.co/) is the “porting” of The Pragmatic Engineer’s Resume template to this resume builder. I collaborated with the Standard Resume team in building this template. I find this template slightly more readable and better formatted than The Pragmatic Engineer’s Resume Template, thanks to the touch up from the Standard Resume design team.

**Markdown to PDF Resume Template**

[Markdown to PDF resume template generator](http://pragmaticurl.com/resume-template-ttr-markdown) by Mike Lee Williams is a neat way to use Markdown as the source of truth for your resume and to store different versions on GitHub.

**The Experienced Engineer’s Resume Template**

[The Experienced Engineer's Resume Template](http://pragmaticurl.com/resume-template-ttr-experienced-engineers) is a template designed as a two-page template for experienced developers with standout experience. It works well for above senior candidates (principal, staff, distinguished engineers), people with standout companies on their resume, or for people with additional standout contributions (e.g. open source projects or contributions).

The main body is divided into 'WORK EXPERIENCE' and 'EDUCATION' sections.  'WORK EXPERIENCE' lists three roles:  Uber, Senior Software Engineer (Amsterdam, Netherlands, Sep 2018-Present), detailing results, impact, and contributions with specific instructions on quantifying achievements and using active language; Skyscanner, Software Engineer II (London, UK, 2017-2018), similarly structured with bullet points outlining results and impact; and Skype, Software Developer (London, UK, 2015-2017),  again emphasizing results and impact, but advising on reducing detail for older positions.  Finally, LogMeIn (London, UK, Summer 2014) is listed with similar instructions. The 'EDUCATION' section details a MsC in Computer Science from the University of Munich (2013-2014, GPA: 4.0) and a BSc in Computer Science from Budapest University of Technology &amp; Economics (2010-2013, Top 2% of the class).

**Standard Resume Venables Template (Paid)**

[The Venables resume template](http://pragmaticurl.com/resume-template-ttr-venables) from [Standard Resume](https://standardresume.co/) is the “porting” of The Experienced Engineer’s Resume template to this resume builder. As with the Parker template, I also collaborated with Standard Resume in building it.

## Other Resume Templates

There are other resume templates that are not great choices for a developer or engineering manager resume for different reasons. We’ll look at the ones that I’ve seen most frequently used by people:

-   Google Docs: Serif resume template
-   Google Docs: Swiss resume template
-   Canva resume templates
-   Resume.io: software engineer template
-   Resume.io: web developer template with skill points
-   VisualCV: Standard template
-   EnhanCV: software engineer template
-   Europass CV

Although I hesitate to recommend these templates, they could work well enough when addressing their drawbacks, or for certain use cases. Don’t forget that the resume contents matter more than the template itself.

Let’s review the templates, analyzing both the issues, as well as their strengths.

**Google Docs Serif Resume Template**

I am not a fan of two-column resumes, as they make it hard to scan from top to bottom and they squeeze the space you can add for your experiences. However, if you go with one, the [Google Docs Serif resume](http://pragmaticurl.com/resume-template-ttr-serif) is still an okay choice. It is not specific to software development, so I would change “Skills” to “Technologies” and remove the Awards / Languages.

<table class="split-50"><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Rating for software developers: ★★★☆☆</strong></p><p><strong>The good:</strong></p><ul><li>Clean format and nice use of colors.</li><li>A one-page resume format.</li></ul><p><strong>The bad:</strong></p><ul><li>It’s harder for recruiters to scan and answer the question of “how much experience do you have?”</li><li>Dates are hard to find.</li><li>You don’t have much space to write about your experience and the impact you made.</li><li>For a two-page resume with more experience, this format doesn’t work as well.</li><li>It’s not specific for tech. “Awards” and “Languages” make little sense.</li></ul><p><strong>Ways to improve it:</strong></p><ul><li>Only use this template if you can definitely fit everything on one page.</li><li>Customize the right column and make good use of it. “Awards” are rarely relevant for tech resumes. Look at tips on improving the EnhanCV software engineer resume.</li></ul></td><td><figure class="py-1"><div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img alt="Image represents a tech resume template.  At the top, 'Your Name' is prominently displayed in a large font, followed by a contact address including street, city, state, zip code, phone number ('(123) 456-7890'), and email address ('no_reply@example.c'). Below this, the resume is sectioned into 'EXPERIENCE,' listing three past job roles, each with 'Company, Location — Job Title,' followed by employment dates (e.g., 'MONTH 20XX - PRESENT' or 'MONTH 20XX - MONTH 20XX') and a brief description using placeholder text ('Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh.').  An 'EDUCATION' section follows a similar format, detailing two educational experiences with 'School Name, Location — Degree,' dates, and descriptive text.  A 'PROJECTS' section includes a single project with 'Project Name — Detail' and a description.  On the right side, 'SKILLS,' 'AWARDS,' and 'LANGUAGES' sections list skills, awards received, and languages known, respectively, all using placeholder text with a similar structure and format.  The entire layout is clean and organized, using consistent formatting and spacing throughout." loading="lazy" width="371" height="438" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 840px) min(371px, 100vw), (max-width: 1200px) min(371px, 80vw), min(371px, 80vw)" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c2-resume-templates%2Fresume_template_serif-ZDJ7HEQA.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 640w, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c2-resume-templates%2Fresume_template_serif-ZDJ7HEQA.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 750w, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c2-resume-templates%2Fresume_template_serif-ZDJ7HEQA.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 828w, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c2-resume-templates%2Fresume_template_serif-ZDJ7HEQA.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c2-resume-templates%2Fresume_template_serif-ZDJ7HEQA.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c2-resume-templates%2Fresume_template_serif-ZDJ7HEQA.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c2-resume-templates%2Fresume_template_serif-ZDJ7HEQA.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, ./images/p3-c2-resume-templates_11_resume_template_serif-ZDJ7HEQA.png 3840w" src="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c2-resume-templates%2Fresume_template_serif-ZDJ7HEQA.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></figure></td></tr></tbody></table>

**Google Docs Swiss Resume Template**

While I do not recommend using the [Google Docs Swiss resume](http://pragmaticurl.com/resume-template-ttr-swiss) as is. What I like about this template is the order of the sections. Otherwise, this template is not a good choice for a software developer’s resume.

<table class="split-50"><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Rating for software developers: ★★☆☆☆</strong></p><p><strong>The good:</strong></p><ul><li>Order of sections: skills (technologies/languages), work experience, then education.

Both offer a similar layout but better formatting.</li></ul></td><td><figure class="py-1"><div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img alt="Image represents a tech resume template.  At the top, the candidate's name ('Your Name') is prominently displayed in a large font, followed by their job title ('Creative Director') in a smaller, bold, orange font. Below this, contact information is listed: a street address ('123 Your Street, Your City, ST 12345'), phone number ('123.456.7890'), and email address ('no_reply@example.com'). The resume is then sectioned into 'Skills,' 'Experience,' and 'Education.'  The 'Skills' section currently only contains a placeholder Lorem ipsum text. The 'Experience' section lists three previous roles, each with 'Company Name / Job Title,' employment dates ('MONTH 20XX - MONTH 20XX' or 'MONTH 20XX - PRESENT'), location, and a description using Lorem ipsum text.

**Canva Resume Templates (Paid)**

If you have a subscription to [Canva Pro](http://pragmaticurl.com/canvapro-ttr), you have the option of using hundreds of resume templates, included in the subscription. I’ve done many of the illustrations in this book [with Canva](http://pragmaticurl.com/canvapro-ttr), and Canva is gaining more and more popularity, thanks to a good price-for-value monthly pricing.

**On the points system**

<table class="split-50"><tbody><tr><td><p>This resume template is an example of using the points system to “score” how strong you are in certain areas. However, here’s why this approach doesn’t work well:</p><ul><li>Anything you score yourself 3 points or lower out of 5 should likely not be on your resume. Why would you mention a technology in which you rate yourself at a low score?</li><li>Anything mentioned as 4 or 5 stars is a given, without the star system as well. Recruiters and hiring managers will assume you are proficient with anything you list on your resume. Why else would you mention it?</li><li>Your rating will likely be off anyway. I have seen people rate themselves as 5 stars on a language in which they seemed to not know things that I thought were basics. I’ve also had someone rate themselves 2 stars on a framework that they turned out to be solid at.

Similar to how a profile photo won’t help your resume, star ratings can only work against you. Drop the ratings and keep all technologies relevant for the position that you are proficient with.

**EuroPass CV**

Avoid this CV template in applying for tech jobs. The biggest sin of this format is encouraging adding all the details that lead to biases: photos, birth dates, gender, and so on. The Europass format is also *not* required to apply to jobs in Europe—contrary to what some people incorrectly assume.

**Every tech recruiter I’ve spoken with advised to not use this format** - and I advise the same. The Europass format was created by a working group within the European Commission. Though I could not confirm this officially, several recruiters mentioned hearing that there was no recruiter, HR specialist or job seeker in this committee.
