# PART 1: RESUMES AND THE HIRING PROCESS

Before jumping into the specifics on how to write a good developer resume, we need to take a pause. Why do you need to write a resume? What does a good developer resume look like, anyway? And why not just use your LinkedIn profile?

Once you submit a resume, what will happen to it? Will a recruiter look at it? Or a hiring manager? Or someone else—perhaps an automated process making a decision?

This part shares the context that recruiters and hiring managers would call trivial. However, if you are not a technical recruiter or a hiring manager, much of the details in this part will be eye-opening. Like what hiring managers see as good resumes, or what happens to your resume behind the scene.

**In [Chapter 1: Why Resumes and CVs are Important](./p1-c1-why-resumes-and-cvs-are-important.md)**, we discuss what the goal of a resume really is. Spoiler it’s not to showcase all of your past experience. We cover what a good resume is like, and why LinkedIn might not be sufficient to get a job when you directly apply.

**In [Chapter 2: The Hiring Pipeline](./p1-c2-the-hiring-pipeline.md),** we share the bigger picture of how the interview process looks—so you can better understand why resumes are important.

Let’s start by diving into why resumes are important at all, at times when LinkedIn is such a popular way to represent yourself professionally.
