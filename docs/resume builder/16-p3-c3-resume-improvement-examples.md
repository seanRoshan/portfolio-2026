# Chapter 12: Resume Improvement Examples

This section is a collection of real resumes that you can use as inspiration when writing yours. Remember that your resume should be about *your* experience, tailored for the *specific* position you are applying for.

I started writing this book after offering to review resumes for software developers who were looking for jobs. Having received too many requests for me to review in-depth, I started to send an early version of this book as feedback for people—this book was at 30 pages, so much shorter than it is today!

The below examples are real resumes that I received. They were often ones where the author was not receiving the type of response rate they were hoping for. You’ll read the initial analysis of the resume, then see the improved version that the author ended up using as their “master” resume.

All examples are anonymized: names of people, companies, schools, locations and dates have been altered to not allow tracking back to the original author. The other features of the resume are as they were—giving you an idea of some typical areas that you could also address with your current resume.

**Resist copying anything one-for-one from these examples.** These resumes are someone else’s experience. Use these to get inspiration, and see if your resume has similar improvement opportunities.

**The original resume**

![Image represents a tech resume for Edmond Smith, structured into distinct sections.  The top section displays contact information:  name ('Edmond Smith'), mailing address ('TNC NT1, Cape Town'), email ('edmondsmith88@example.com'), and website ('https://EdmondSmithDev.github.io/'). Below this is a 'TECH STACKS' section listing the technologies Edmond is proficient in, categorized into Programming Languages/Frameworks (PHP/Laravel, JavaScript/Express, Java/Kotlin for Android), Database (Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB), Infrastructure (AWS), Testing Tools (PHPUnit, Mockery), and API Specs (REST). The main body is the 'WORK EXPERIENCE' section, detailing Edmond's roles chronologically. Each role (Cloudless, MennoMark (twice), South Business School, AdvancedLearning, Loud Fort, The Trace Foundation) is presented as a heading, followed by bullet points describing responsibilities, technologies used (e.g., PHP/Laravel, Kotlin, Java, Go), projects (e.g., MennoInnova, MennoMini), and dates of employment.  The information flows chronologically downwards, with each role's description providing details about the tasks performed and technologies employed within that specific timeframe.  Specific technologies and project names are highlighted throughout the descriptions, providing a clear picture of Edmond's skills and experience.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c3-resume-improvement-examples%2Fresume_1_before_1-DG4ROJUE.png&w=3840&q=75)

![Image represents a tech resume structured into sections:  'VOLUNTEER WORK' details involvement as a Developer Community Lead at Facebook Developer Circles Cape Town (Aug 2016-present), including managing online user groups, organizing events, and building partnerships; 'EDUCATION' lists a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Cape Town University (Sep 2013-Jun 2017); 'AWARDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS' highlights 'Developer Community Work Spotlight' (Dec 2018) and 'MasterCard Foundation Scholar' (2013-2017); 'SKILLS AND INTERESTS' outlines experience in architecture and design, software engineering tools (Git, Trello, Slack), object-oriented programming, front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular), and debugging tools (Chrome DevTool), along with an interest in community building and technical writing; and 'PERSONAL PROJECTS' showcases 'bareGo,' a project focusing on software architecture and design using PHP, and 'RESTAPI with Node,' demonstrating modern API design principles; finally, 'Technical Writing' describes writing about technical concepts on the Dev.to platform.  Each section uses bullet points to list specific accomplishments, skills, or project details, with dates provided where applicable.  The information flows chronologically, starting with volunteer work, then education, achievements, skills, and finally personal projects.  No URLs or parameters are explicitly visible.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c3-resume-improvement-examples%2Fresume_1_before_2-TFIXLBYV.png&w=3840&q=75)

**Analysis of the resume**

Overall, this is not a bad resume—but there are many improvements that could make it a much stronger one for this position.

**The good**

-   **Key details on the first page**. Languages & technologies, as well as work experience, are listed on the first page.
-   **Good amount of personal details**. This resume doesn’t share too many unnecessary personal details.
-   **A decent template and usage of bullet points**. The template helps with good usage of space, and bullet points make it easy to read the statements.

**Improvement areas**

-   **Overly generous spacing.** The margins on the sides of the resume were unusually large—reducing the space of what would fit on each of the pages. While good spacing can benefit resumes, there is no reason to have very large spacing on the top and the side.
-   **Consistency**. Formatting is not consistent, and it brings a sloppy feel for the resume. Font sizes and alignment are different in different sections.
-   **Drawing focus to the wrong thing.** This resume has many links—the person linked to all their previous companies. When glancing at the resume, the recruiter’s attention is immediately drawn to the names of companies. However, it would be smarter to draw attention to the title of the engineer and the date. A different template could help with this, as would toning down link colors.
-   **The impact of the work**. Within the work experience, there could be more specific impact mentioned about the person's work. There are some specifics, but there are also a lot of phrases like “Built a mobile app”, without explaining what was impactful, challenging or interesting about it.
-   **Linking to company websites**. The links to company websites drew attention but brought little value. If a recruiter or hiring manager wants to look up the company, they can do so without a link, just by searching for the company name. Besides, the company landing page does not convey much relevant information.
-   **Splitting out a 3-month position at MennoMark**. This person got promoted after a few months at MennoMark. They decided to split this 3-month-long position out into separate sections. Because of how fast this promotion was, they could just ignore this short position, not mentioning it.

**The refactored resume**

![Image represents a tech resume for Edmond Smith, structured into distinct sections.  The top displays his name, location (Cape Town, South Africa), email (edmondsmith88@example.com), and a placeholder for a website URL.  A 'TECHNOLOGIES AND LANGUAGES' section lists his proficiencies in various programming languages (PHP, JavaScript, Java, Kotlin, Android, Angular, Laravel, Express.js, Ktor), databases (MySQL, MongoDB), cloud services (AWS), and version control (Git), along with skills in data structures, algorithms, API design, and best practices.  The 'WORK EXPERIENCE' section details three roles:  'Backend Software Engineer' at Cloudless (Sep 2018-present), focusing on improving customer conversion and API re-architecture; 'Development Team Lead' at MennoMark (Jan 2017-Aug 2018), involving app development and team management; and 'Developer and Trainer' at South Business School (Summer 2017), where he designed and taught an Android development bootcamp.  A 'Guest Author' section describes his contributions to AdvancedLearning, including writing and updating articles on Angular.  Finally, a 'Software Developer Intern' role at Loud Fort (Summer 2017) involved building an internal web tool.  The 'EDUCATION' section concludes the resume, stating his Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Cape Town University (2013-2017) and his receipt of a MasterCard Foundation scholarship.  Each work experience entry includes a company name, dates of employment, and a bulleted list of accomplishments.  The resume uses a clear, concise format with consistent formatting and clear section headings.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c3-resume-improvement-examples%2Fresume_1_after_1-RHGAI432.png&w=3840&q=75)

![Image represents a section of a tech resume titled 'PROJECTS AND VOLUNTEER WORK,'  listing four distinct projects or volunteer experiences as bullet points.  The first bullet point describes a community leadership role at Facebook Developer Circles, involving the creation of a 500-developer group, organization of over 30 events and hackathons, and featuring in the 'Community Storytellers' Series.' The second bullet point details 'BareGo,' a minimal and progressive PHP framework with its source code available on GitHub. The third bullet point showcases a REST API project built with Node.js, highlighting its use of modern API design principles like HATEOAS, caching, and content negotiation, with the source code also linked on GitHub.  Finally, the fourth bullet point mentions technical blogging on Dev.to and as a guest publisher, specifically referencing articles on Angular Material and Clean Code.  No visual connections are present; the information flows linearly through the sequential listing of projects, each with a brief description and, in some cases, links to external resources like GitHub and Dev.to.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c3-resume-improvement-examples%2Fresume_1_after_2-J22STCTE.png&w=3840&q=75)

**Analysis of the refactored resume**

The refactored resume addressed most of the improvements we previously mentioned. A few things to call out with this improved resume are:

-   **Tailored for the position the person is applying for**. For example, the position mentioned languages like C++, Java, PHP, JavaScript etc. As the person is hands-on with PHP and JavaScript, the resume lists these first.
-   **Impact and what this person actively did comes across more clearly**. The updated resume uses active language and showcases specific examples of impact. Note how this is exactly the same person, talking about exactly the same work they have done. In the updated version, however, they have gone deeper to express how their work was important beyond just coding.
-   **More concise wording, with just as much details**. The two resumes convey roughly the same amount of information. However, in the second one, much of the irrelevant or repetitive information has been cut.
-   **More deliberate guiding of the reader’s focus.** In the original resume, links were scattered. Take the technical blogging section: in the original resume, this was just a link to the Dev.to page of this engineer. Now, instead of linking to a blog, this person calls out two articles they’d like the hiring manager to glance at. This is a much more focused approach.

**Ways this resume could be made even better:**

-   **A short summary section** is something I’d consider adding, especially if there’s information this candidate can reflect on for the job description. For example, the job description says: *“We strongly encourage candidates who are members of historically underrepresented groups and have non-traditional career paths to apply, including, but not limited to candidates from non-tech industries, candidates without Computer Science degrees who are self-taught, candidates starting second careers to apply.”* If some of this applies to the candidate, I’d encourage them to reflect on this in this section.
-   **Tailor the resume to other positions**, over using this one as a “one-size-fits-all” one.

## Machine Learning Engineer with 5 Years Experience

This resume is from a software engineer in Europe who specialized in machine learning. They were applying to companies but rarely heard back. Their original resume was a 3-pager one.

After refactoring the resume to a 1-pager one below, they saw a lot more leads, including from companies that they did not hear back from before. The person ended up landing a job at one of the companies they were targeting.

**The original resume**

![Image represents a tech resume for Pat Thompson, a Machine Learning Engineer at Lastminute.com Ltd.  The resume is structured into sections:  a header with contact information (location, Github, LinkedIn, email, and website URLs), an 'EXPERIENCE' section listing four roles with company names, locations, dates, and employment types (full-time or contract, remote or on-site), a 'FRAMEWORKS & LIBRARIES' section categorized by Machine Learning, Web, Data Processing, and Other, detailing specific technologies used, an 'EDUCATION' section stating a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of São Paulo, a 'PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES' section showing proficiency levels in Python, Javascript, Elixir, Go, and Kotlin using a dot-based proficiency indicator, a 'CLOUD' section listing AWS services (EC2, RDS, EMR, ECS, SageMaker, S3), a 'TOOLS' section listing various tools (Docker, Terraform, Packer, etc.), and finally, a 'DESIGN PATTERNS' section listing architectural patterns (REST, MVC, etc.).  The sections are clearly labeled and arranged vertically, with information flowing sequentially from the header to the experience, skills, and education details.  The visual design uses bold text for section headers and a consistent layout to enhance readability.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c3-resume-improvement-examples%2Fresume_2_before_1-BPK634VO.png&w=3840&q=75)

![Image represents a detailed tech resume showcasing two roles: Machine Learning Engineer at Lastminute.com (2018-present) and Backend Python Developer at CARRS (2016-2018), both located in Vienna, Austria.  The resume is structured chronologically, starting with the most recent role. Each role includes a brief company description, a statement of purpose, a bulleted list of responsibilities, and a 'Stack' section listing the technologies used.  For the Machine Learning Engineer role, responsibilities include optimizing data pipelines, building tooling for the Data Science team, facilitating integration with production environments, providing best practices, and liaising with stakeholders. The technology stack includes Python, Flask, Docker, Terraform, Git, AWS, TensorFlow, NLTK, Spark, RESTful APIs, Snowflake, Postgres, Airflow, and CUDA+Nvidia. The Backend Python Developer role details responsibilities such as building and maintaining tools to automate internal processes, implementing complex algorithms, performing data analysis, and implementing text classification and sentiment analysis.  Its technology stack includes Python, Flask, RESTful APIs, SQL, ORM libraries, Docker, AWS, Git, Microservices, Keras/Scikit-learn, and NLTK/SpaCy.  There is a clear hierarchical flow, with each role section containing sub-sections detailing responsibilities and technologies used, all presented in a linear, top-to-bottom fashion.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c3-resume-improvement-examples%2Fresume_2_before_2-2GRQBI4S.png&w=3840&q=75)

![Image represents a tech resume structured in sections.  The top section details two previous roles: 'Software Developer' at Lending Limited (2015-2016, remote), describing responsibilities in developing and maintaining internal microservices and web applications, and listing a technology stack including Python, Pyramid, Django, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, MongoDB, AWS, Git, Mercurial, Microservices, Docker, and Go; and 'Machine Learning Developer' at Inno Systems (2015, remote), outlining work on machine learning algorithms, specifying a stack of Python, C++, OpenCV, Sklearn, Pandas, NumPy, Git, AWS, and NLTK. A third section describes the role of 'Founder & Software Engineer' at Future Co. (2014-2015), detailing founding and managing a software company, with a technology stack of Python, Java, Django, HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript, Nginx, JSON, PostgreSQL, MySQL, AWS, and DigitalOcean.  Below this, a 'LANGUAGES' section uses filled and half-filled circles to represent proficiency levels in Portuguese, English, Spanish, Italian, and German. Finally, a 'TALKS' section lists two presentations: 'Scanning the Web with Python' (2014, Python Beach, Brazil) and 'Intro to Python multi-platform framework for Apps Development' (2013, Python Beach, Brazil).  All sections are clearly labeled and arranged vertically, with the 'ADDITIONAL INFORMATION' header separating the work experience from the language and talks sections.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c3-resume-improvement-examples%2Fresume_2_before_3-2PMQEPBS.png&w=3840&q=75)

**Analysis of the resume**

The resume is an instant turn-off. The template is unnecessarily hard to read. The first page feels like it was written just to have buzzwords on it. Also, it immediately tells the story of someone who is either not a good developer or just overly modest. Why would the resume start with this person rating themselves as 4/5 on Python, 3/5 on Javascript?

**The good**

-   **The second and third page** shows depth in experience. Unfortunately, most recruiters and hiring managers likely never got here, and moved this resume to the “reject” pile after scanning the first page.

**Improvement areas**

-   **Use an easy to read template.** The current template makes it hard to scan the resume contents. The black headers draw attention needlessly.
-   **Do not use the skills self-rating**. As discussed in the [Unnecessary Details section](./p2-c4-common-mistakes.md#unnecessary-details), self-rating skills proficiency can only work against you on a resume. This can be seen here, in action. As a hiring manager, I could assume this person is not a good developer, based on their own rating. If they rate their Javascript as 3/5, some hiring managers could assume they are not quite proficient—which is not at all what this person wanted to convey.
-   **Talk about impact and results**, not what you were told to do. In a new field like machine learning, most companies will look for people who take the initiative and get results.
-   **Convey the right type of information on the first page.** This person has a lot to build on: so do this. They should showcase the impactful work they've done, and their skills.
-   **Talk more about themselves, not their companies.** For every position listed, this person writes nearly as much about the company as they do for their achievements. Drop the part on the company: they should focus on their results.
-   **Use bullet points** for easier reading. Much of the resume has paragraphs that list different pieces of information. For example, the first sentence talks about the company and the second one about their achievements. After reading the first sentence, the person scanning the resume would skip to the next paragraph, assuming that a paragraph talks about the same topic.

**The refactored resume**

![Image represents a tech resume for Pat Thompson, structured into sections.  The top displays contact information including personal website (pat_t.dev), GitHub (github.com/pat_t), LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/pat_t), and email (pat_t@icloud.com). The 'EMPLOYMENT' section lists several roles with company names, locations, dates, and bullet points detailing responsibilities and accomplishments.  Each role (Machine Learning Engineer, Backend Engineer, Software Engineer) includes specific projects and technologies used, such as AWS EMR, TensorFlow, Docker, and Terraform. The 'EDUCATION' section shows a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Finally, the 'TECHNOLOGIES' section is divided into 'Programming Languages' (Python, Javascript, Elixir, Go, SQL), 'Frameworks & Libraries' (Django, Flask, Vuejs, Nodejs, etc.), and 'Tools' (AWS, Docker, PostgreSQL, etc.), listing a wide range of skills and software proficiency.  The information flows chronologically, starting with the most recent employment and ending with education.  Each employment entry is associated with a time range indicating the duration of the role.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c3-resume-improvement-examples%2Fresume_2_after_1-U4POAJXV.png&w=3840&q=75)

**Analysis of the refactored resume**

The difference between the original and the refactored resume is striking. The resume is down to one page, is a lot easier to read and conveys the applicant's experience much better. The person applied much of the advice in this book.

They also saw a lot more leads, including from companies that they did not hear back from before. The person ended up landing a job at one of these companies.

Still, there are a few further areas I’d suggest looking at:

-   **Mention specific technologies** they worked with, in the work experience. E.g. instead of *"Created a full-stack web application for internal stakeholders"*, they could say *"Created a full-stack web application for internal stakeholders using Vue,js Django, deploying it on AWS."*
-   **Use numbers** when describing the work experience. E.g. instead of *"Created a full-stack web application for internal stakeholders"*, list specifics like *"Designed, implemented and deployed 4 microservices for the main product. These services serve 100 RPS."*

## Backend Developer with 6 Years Experience

This example is from a backend engineer who spent a few years working at a company building payroll software. They originally intended to use their resume to apply to similar, but larger companies.

With their original resume, they were seeing far less response than they were hoping for. With the improvements, they noticed a considerably higher rate of callbacks, and ended up accepting an offer for a local startup for a senior engineer position.

**The original resume**

![Image represents a tech resume for Nikita Pratley, structured into sections.  The top displays contact information including phone number (+1-234-567-8910), email (nikita.pratley@gmail.com), and LinkedIn profile URL (in/nikitapratley). Below, 'Technical Skills' lists programming languages (Java, SQL, JavaScript, Python), databases (Oracle, SQL Server), cloud platforms (Azure DevOps), and technologies (REST, JSON, XML, SOAP, HTTP, Linux, Jira, Git, SVN, Docker).  The 'Work Experience' section details two roles at PaySolutions: 'Software Engineer - R&D' (February 2019-Present) and 'Software Engineer - Customer Success' (June 2017-February 2019), each listing bullet points describing responsibilities and technologies used (Java, PL/SQL, Postman, T-SQL, MS SQL Server, etc. for R&D; PL/SQL Developer, SQL, JavaScript, Oracle database, Git, SVN, HTML, CSS, Jira for Customer Success).  An 'Intern' section describes work at Nokia (April 2016-May 2017), focusing on user behavior analysis using clustering algorithms (GMMs, K-Means) and R programming.  Finally, a 'Software Engineer' role at GraphTL (November 2012-May 2014) is described, highlighting web application testing using SoapUI and TestComplete.  The resume concludes with an 'Education and Certifications' section listing M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Computer Science from LMU University of Munich and BIT Bangalore Institute of Technology, respectively.  The entire document flows vertically, with each section clearly labeled and containing detailed information about Nikita Pratley's skills and experience.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c3-resume-improvement-examples%2Fresume_3_before_1-2JSC3MWT.png&w=3840&q=75)

**Analysis of the resume**

This resume is a decent one to start with—however, it can be further improved.

**The good**

-   **Technical skills on the top**. This person was aiming to apply for companies that hired for specific tech stacks. In this case, starting with relevant technologies is a good strategy.
-   **A one-page resume**. This person had around five-six years’ experience, and they managed to fit the key parts onto one page.
-   **Mentioning results and numbers**. The resume had specifics, like the percentage of reducing the client ticket support rate or performance improvements.
-   **Good amount of personal details**. This resume doesn’t share too many unnecessary personal details.
-   **A decent template and usage of bullet points**. The template helps with good usage of space, and bullet points make it easy to read the statements.

**Improvement areas**

-   **Missing location** on the resume. When no address is listed, recruiters might assume the person is out of the country. This was not the case with this person; they were based in Vancouver, Canada. So why not list it?
-   **Technologies dumped one after the other.** While it’s good to list all technologies this person is proficient with, the formatting and the order could be better. Focus on languages and frameworks that are needed for the position, or that this person wants to call out specifically.
-   **Too much bolding.** Much of the bolding is distracting, and some of it makes little sense. Why are all the technical skills in bold? Why are some of the results bolded out? Why are *“W4 forms”* bolded? Though the person writing the resume probably wanted to be helpful, they draw attention to the wrong areas.
-   **Could use more specifics**. Though there are specifics for some bullet points, others could use more details. Take the statement *“Created troubleshooting tools that improved support team’s efficiency by more than 30%”*. What languages or frameworks did this person use for the tools? Did they come up with an idea? Did they lead a team? How many customers used the tools?
-   **Grammar**. Some of the sentences don’t read naturally: using a grammar checker would have surfaced these. Taking the previous example: *“Created troubleshooting tools that improved **the** support team’s efficiency by more than 30%”*.
-   **Education dates are missing**. As a hiring manager and a recruiter, not seeing education dates is confusing. Did the person graduate? If so, why not add the dates? If they did not, why don’t they mention that they dropped out?
-   **Dates could be better placed.** Moving the dates to the right side would make them much easier to scan on the first glance.
-   **Docx format.** The original resume was a docx. Using PDFs is a much better choice.

**The refactored resume**

![Image represents a tech resume for Nikita Pratley, structured into sections.  The top displays contact information:  Vancouver, Canada location, a LinkedIn URL (implied), phone number ((234) 567 8910), and email address (nikita.pratley@gmail.com).  Below, 'Technical Skills' lists programming languages (Java, JavaScript, Python, SQL), databases (Oracle, PL/SQL, SQL Server, Microsoft Azure), tools (Git, Docker, REST), and DevOps experience.  'Work Experience' details three roles: Software Engineer at PaySolutions (Feb 2019-Present and 2017-Feb 2019), with quantifiable achievements in cost reduction, support ticket resolution, and workflow improvement, using technologies like Java, Workday, ADP, and SAP Concur; Intern at Nokia (2016-2017), focusing on real-time user behavior monitoring using clustering algorithms (GMMs, K-Means) and R/R Studio; and Software Engineer at GraphTL (2012-2014), where regression reduction was achieved through automated testing with SoapUI, TestComplete, JavaScript, and Perl.  Finally, 'Education and Certifications' lists an M.Sc. in Computer Science from LMU University of Munich and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from BIT Bangalore Institute of Technology, with corresponding years of study.  Each work experience entry includes the company name, location, dates of employment, and a bulleted list of accomplishments.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c3-resume-improvement-examples%2Fresume_3_after_1-LXZY7FQ2.png&w=3840&q=75)

**Analysis of the refactored resume**

The refactored resume addressed all the above improvement areas, and the person ended up with more calls and an offer with a local startup. The main improvements from the original resume were:

-   **Mentioning their location** as Vancouver, Canada and not omitting it, like before.
-   **Languages and technologies listed more strategically** and tailored for the job they are applying for. This person was going after mostly Java-based positions. They listed programming languages first, then the technologies relevant for the job that they were proficient in.
-   **An easier to scan template** with dates and positions standing out.
-   **Starting with the impact of their work** in their work experiences, instead of burying this information deeper.
-   **Giving more specifics** on their work experience. For example, they mentioned leading a small team, which they previously left off.
-   **Dropping months from older dates**—from four or more years back. It makes the dates easier to scan. This person didn’t have a gap in their employment since 2016, and this can make scanning their resume a bit easier.
-   **Adding education dates** to add more context on how long they have been doing software development.

## Remote Software Engineer With 8 Years Experience

The below resume is a 2-page CV for a senior software engineer based in Europe. This person was primarily targeting remote positions.

The candidate behind this resume struggled to get responses from international companies, even though they were a senior candidate. Following the refactor, their response rate increased dramatically, and they ended up choosing one of the multiple offers they secured.

**The original resume**

![Image represents a visually appealing tech resume for Dan Mitcch, a Software Engineer.  The resume is structured into distinct sections, each with a relevant icon.  The top section displays Dan's name, title ('SOFTWARE ENGINEER'), contact information (phone number: +32-20-222-2222, email: DAN.MITCCH@GMAIL.COM, location: WARSAW, POLAND), and a statement indicating openness to remote positions. Below this, the 'EDUCATION' section details his graduation from Warsaw University of Technology (2007-2011) with a focus on Systems Development.  The adjacent 'EXPERIENCE' section lists his work history, including roles at Ericsson Communications (Software Developer, Test Responsible, 2012-2013), TTL LLC (Software Developer, Technical Leader, 2013-2016), Sumo Logic (Engineer of Engine Team, 2016-2018), Drive LLC (Developer, Arch-Dev Team, 2019-2020), and current freelancing (2020-).

![Image represents a detailed experience section of a tech resume, structured as a chronologically ordered list of work experiences.  Each experience is presented as a titled block (e.g., 'FREELANCER (HOMESHOP TECHNOLOGIES LLC)'), followed by a bulleted list of responsibilities and accomplishments.  The blocks are arranged vertically, with the most recent experience at the top (2020-present for Freelancer) and progressing downwards to the earliest (2012-2013 for Ericsson Communications).  To the right of each experience block is a corresponding date range indicating the duration of employment.  Within each bulleted list, specific technologies and programming languages used are mentioned (e.g., Python, C++, Java, Jenkins, CMake, Bash, etc.), along with descriptions of tasks performed, such as developing microservices, customizing existing solutions, performing unit testing, and managing build environments.  The overall structure clearly showcases the candidate's professional journey, highlighting their skills and experience in software development and related fields.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c3-resume-improvement-examples%2Fresume_4_before_2-PBAHGA6U.png&w=3840&q=75)

**Analysis of the resume**

I was not surprised to see that this person barely received calls from recruiters. This resume did an excellent job in breaking several unwritten CV "rules" and downplaying the candidate's experience.

**The good**

-   **Not much good to say** about this resume, beyond the fact that the person behind the resume has a *lot* of experience to build on. Let’s jump instead to the biggest improvement areas.

**Improvement areas**

-   **Confusing layout** that starts with education. Most recruiters would stop reading after the first page - however, the second page contains most of their “proper” experience.
-   **Photo** that introduces bias. Just remove it.
-   **Irrelevant skills listed**. Leadership? Cat-B driving license for a remote developer job? Remove these.
-   **Skills with 1-5 points** make it seem like this person is a poor engineer. They rate themselves 4 stars at most, and one star on Node.JS. Talking to this person, they were an expert or proficient on most technologies. I advised them to remove the rating altogether.
-   **Reverse chronological work experience**. On the first page, the oldest experience is listed first. This is both confusing and shows this person is unaware of resume basics.
-   **Only talking about “what” they did, not the results.** The resume does not use active language, and does not do a good job describing the results this person delivered.

**The refactored resume**

![Image represents a tech resume for Dan Mitcch, structured into sections.  The top displays contact information:  LinkedIn and GitHub URLs are implied but not explicitly shown, along with a mobile phone number (+3220 2222222) and email address (dan.micch@gmail.com).  Below, a 'Skills' section lists 'Languages and technologies,' detailing expertise in Python and C++, along with numerous frameworks (Flask, Selenium, Numpy, Qt5, Boost, POCO), CI systems, database systems (SQL, NoSQL), and other languages (JavaScript, Java, TypeScript, C#).  Proficiency in API and architecture design, TDD, and ISTQB Foundations certification are also highlighted.  An 'Education' section states Dan's degree as an Engineer of Computer Sciences, BSC from Warsaw University of Technology and Economics (graduated 2011).  The 'Work experience' section chronologically lists roles:  Freelancer at Homeshop Technologies (2020 spring - present), creating backend microservices with significant performance improvements; Developer at Drive LLC (2019 summer - 2020 spring), focusing on self-driving vehicle software development; a sabbatical break (2018 winter - 2019 summer) involving Python projects and CNC mill operation; Engineer of Engine Team at Sumo Logic (2016 - 2018 winter), refactoring a network interface; and Technical Leader (senior) at TTL LLC (2015-2016), managing software projects.

**Analysis of the refactored resume**

The refactored resume performed far better. This person heard back from companies who ignored their previous resume. They did well on multiple interviews and had several offers to choose from in a matter of weeks.

There’s always room for improvement, though, and I would still suggest the following changes to make this CV even stronger:

-   **More consistent formatting** as a whole. The spacing and bullet points have a strange layout.
-   **Date formatting** could be cleaner. Using seasons is fine for e.g. internships (“summer 2011), but instead of “2019 summer - 2020 spring”, “Jun 2019 - Mar 2020” reads more clear.
-   **Use active language**. Instead of “Creating backend microservices…”, say “Created backend microservices…”.
-   **No need to repeat the header** on the second page - it just wastes space.
-   **Education**: move it further down. With a degree almost 10 years ago, this is far less relevant than their work experience.
-   **Consider using a better template or a resume template service** like Standard Resume for a more professional layout. This person went alone with the template, customizing it themselves. It still feels very DIY, and resume layout is not their strength.

## SRE Engineer with 20 Years Experience

The resume is from a systems admin working in a high performance computing environment, who holds a PhD. They have been happily employed for over 10 years at their current workplace. Their original resume was just adding details of the last 10 years’ employment to the same resume they used when applying in 2010.

Following the refactor, this person saw a good amount of interest. They ended up getting and accepting an SRE offer - exactly the position they were after.

**The original resume**

**Analysis of the resume**

This resume feels dated just by glancing at the template. Unfortunately, subconscious biases can be a thing in tech, and some hiring managers might wonder if this is a person who would keep up with technology. Having interacted with the person, I can tell you they are - but their resume does not indicate this.

**The good**

-   **A very experienced candidate**. With a PhD and close to 20 years of professional experience, this candidate has a lot of things to bring to the table.
-   **Lots of relevant technologies**. HAProxy, Prometheus, ELK and other technologies they’ve listed are considered close to cutting edge in 2020. This person clearly keeps up to date or works at a place that moves with the industry.

**Improvement areas**

-   **Too long of an intro** with too few specifics. Trim the introduction, and talk about results.
-   **Irrelevant key skills** listed on the first page. *“Excellent interpersonal skills”* misses specifics, and *“Training course design”* is not a skill that is relevant for the positions this person is applying for.
-   **Ten years in a job with no career advancement**. This person had been employed in the same place since 2010. Were they promoted? Or are they the most senior person already? The resume doesn't help answer this question. It should!
-   **Irrelevant older positions** listed. Senior training consultant 2004-2008 doesn’t add much to the resume, nor does the first few systems admin positions. The resume would read stronger if it emitted those: especially that this person is looking to apply for SRE positions.
-   **Missing results of the work.** For an experienced candidate, it’s expected they bring results to the table. The resume doesn’t showcase these.
-   **Cliches** in some of the descriptions like “excellent interpersonal skills”, “excellent communication”. Remove these, or replace them with specifics.

**The refactored resume**

![Image represents a tech resume for Sam Smith, structured into distinct sections.  The top displays contact information: location (London, UK), LinkedIn and GitHub URLs, phone number (+441(23) 456789), and email address (sam.smith_@gmail.com). Below, a 'Technologies and Languages' section lists programming languages (C, Bash, Python, Perl, Go, PHP, Java) and technologies/tools used (Linux, LAMP stack, TCP/IP, HAProxy, Keepalived, OpenNebula Cloud, Spectrum Scale, Elastic Stack, Docker, Jenkins, GitLab CI, SaltStack, Ansible, Prometheus, Grafana), categorized into 'Languages,' 'Technologies,' 'Tools,' and 'Other' (CI/CD, Parallel Programming, Cluster Management, High Availability, Load Balancers).  The 'Work Experience' section details Sam's role as Senior Systems Administrator at University College London (2012-Present), outlining responsibilities including leading a team of 3 administrators managing 300 physical and 150 virtual machines across two data centers, providing virtualization resources and 300TB of storage.  This section further describes technical leadership on 10 HPC Linux clusters, improvements in monitoring and alerting systems (replacing Nagios and Cacti with Prometheus, Grafana, and Elasticsearch), automation of cluster node remediation, optimization of health checks, CI/CD pipeline creation, and contributions to infrastructure-as-code.  Specific achievements are quantified, such as reducing downtime and improving uptime percentages.  The resume showcases a strong focus on automation, efficiency improvements, and team leadership within a large-scale HPC environment.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c3-resume-improvement-examples%2Fresume_5_after_1-PRXO5W5U.png&w=3840&q=75)

![Image represents a tech resume structured into distinct sections:  'Systems Administrator,' 'Education,' 'Projects and Community,' 'Teaching and Training,' and 'Interests.'  The 'Systems Administrator' section details experience (2010-2012) at University College London, UK, including building a custom node provisioning system using PXE, DHCP, DNS, and SaltStack; implementing version control; setting up two 1000-core HPC clusters; and developing monitoring tools for a parallel file system (Spectrum Scale/GPFS) integrated with Nagios. The 'Education' section lists three degrees from University College London: an M.Sc. in Mathematics (2011-2012), an M.Sc. in Computer Science (2001-2003), and a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Mathematics (1997-2001).  'Projects and Community' highlights contributions to open-source projects (Mox Money, Mox Tasks, IPAM-lite) hosted on GitHub, along with contributions to Cacti, Nagios, and Drupal, and conference speaking engagements.  'Teaching and Training' describes a Master's degree in High-Performance Computing and teaching experience, including a 5-credit course on scientific and technical computing, supervising dissertations, and organizing training for the Research IT unit at University College London. Finally, 'Interests' mentions marathon running and science fiction reading.  The entire resume is presented as a bulleted list, with dates provided for educational and professional experiences.  No URLs or parameters are explicitly visible beyond the implicit reference to GitHub.](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fcourses%2Ftech-resume%2Fp3-c3-resume-improvement-examples%2Fresume_5_after_2-XKYOA5NV.png&w=3840&q=75)

**Analysis of the refactored resume**

The refactored resume addressed all the above improvement areas:

-   **An easier to read template** than before that also feels more modern.
-   **Technologies and languages** jump out when starting to read the resume. It’s clear that this person has experience with many of the latest distributed computing technologies.
-   **Using active language** when describing their work experience.
-   **The impact and results** come across far better in the work experience section. The language used is active, and there are lots of specifics.
-   **Promotion is called out** in their current position. Instead of 10 years and no promotion, the story is more clear: promotion after 2 years, and they are now leading the HPC team, likely being the most senior HPC administrator.
-   **Cutting out older positions** that don’t add in helping with the job search. The resume is cleaner and more focused. And as a hiring manager, I wouldn’t really care what this person worked on before their MsC, as in the decade since then, they’ve shown solid results.
-   **Projects, teaching and training add to the resume**. The projects linked are solid, with the GitHub repos linked in the resume. Both conference talks and teaching at the university close off this strong resume nicely.

As an interesting point, even the refactored resume is two pages. This works for two reasons. First, this person is applying in the UK, for more mature organizations, where the one-page resume is not that common. Second, they have enough meaningful experience to fill the pages up with Ten years of work experience does warrant a full page.

In the end, the refactor most likely helped this person stand out from the crowd, telling a much stronger story than the original resume did.
